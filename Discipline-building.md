# Insights

The most important question to ask is: what pain do you want in your life? What are you willing to struggle for? 
Anything worthwhile is going to require some degree of pain and struggle, so if you are oriented toward the pain and the struggle, you're probably going to be more aligned with what you are capable of accomplishing rather than if you orient towards the pleasures.

Discipline  = importance of goal (why) + psicological pleasure of the pursuit of the goal - psicological  cost of the pursuit of the goal

Lower the entry resistance to anythin g you really wanna do, it should be harder not to do it than to do it

Extrinsic motivation is money, status and praise. This motivation works but for the human brain, anticipation is more rewarding that attainment

Intrinsic motivation is curiosity, mastery, autotelicity, purpose and autonomy

Curiosity is the insatiably itch to learn anything you can about your work

Purpose is when you make sacrefices because the work is a cause you care about

Mastery is the pursuit of excellence and continuous improvement

Autotelicity is the love for the activity you do at work (self-purpose)

Autonomy is the feeling of being in control of the when, the how and the what of your work

Wherever your mind drifts is a compass to curiosity

The flow concept was developed as a resuult of sheer curiosity. It was the fruit of "pure" research, motivated only by the desire to solve an intriguing puzzle in the mechanism of human behavior

Curiosity activates the brain's reward system, releasing dopamine which increases attention and pleasure in learning

Mastery is the thirst to be better today than yesterday, challenge/skill balance

Autotelicity working late not because you have too but because you want to. Behave as what you are doing is the most important thing in the world

Purpose is the belief that your activities contribute for something bigger than yourself. It turns a job into a mission

Autonomy is what you choose, tackling a project however you want it

Identify where you are at this present moment

Curiosity - How many times over the last 30 days, did you have the desire to read, watch or listen to content related to your work outside the formal work hours?

To boost curiosity you need: 
Leverage from learning - the knowledge you gain, as a positive impact on your work.
Immediate feedback from your learning - Seeing your learnings applied to your work

Mastery - In the last 30 days, to what degree did you feel the desire to endlessly improve the skillset desired for your work?

To boost mastery you need:
Identify all your skills and sub-skills that will advance your currrent goals
Practice those skills relentlessly

Autotelicity - In the last 30 days, how often did you spontaneasly dive into one of the core activities in your work without any obligation
               How often have you found that when you weren't doing one of the main activities within your work, you were craving to do it?


To boost autotelicity you need:
What am I good at?

Purpose - Does the organization I work within or the work I do have any purpose attached to it at all?
          Is that a purpose I can get behind and feel good pouring my life force into?

To boost purpose you need:
A well articulated purpose and a clear correlation between that purpose and your work drive up both motivation and job satisfaction

Distill your life mission into one laser focused sentence: Ex. "Advance technological inovation for global good", everyday next to each work task identify how it links to your purpose

Autonomy - In the last 30 days, the degree to which the HOW, the WHAT, the WHY, or the WHEN, related to your work felt like it something you were in control

To boost autonomy you need:
Take a step back from your current situation and zoom-out, see the current situation as a stepaping stone in the overall journey you control and shape
Give yourself FU options, skills which allow you to fallback on when you no longer see the current sistuation aligning with your journey
