# Happiness advantage by Shawn Achor

We’ve been taught that if we work hard, we will be successful, and then we’ll be happy. 
But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this formula is actually backward: happiness fuels success, not the other way around.

# Insights

Hapiness is not the belief that we don't need to change; it is the realization that we can.

Success orbits around hapiness

Happiness is the experience of positive emotions - pleasure combined with deeper feeling of meaning and purpose.
(positive mood in the present and positive outlook for the future)

Happiness = pleasure + engagement + meaning

Happiness is the joy we feel striving for our potential

Prime your brain with happy thoughts or activity before doing something

Find something to look forward to - remind yourself and anticipate future rewards

Commit conscious acts of kindness

Infuse positivity into your surroundings - decorate your work environment happier, spend 20 min outside in good weather and remove negative inducing things from your environment

Spend money but not on stuff - spend money on experiences, specially with others, or spend money on other people

Exercise a signature strenght - revisit a talent you haven't used in a while or exercise a strenght in character ( go to www.viasurvey.com )

Use cheerful enthusiasm or serene warmth when talking to people

3:1 ratio - 3 positive interactions to fend off 1 bad
6:1 ratio - makes everything grow ( god mode )

Reality is merely our brains relative understanding of the world

The mental construction of our daily activities, more than the activities themselves, defines our reality

The more you believe in your hability to succeed, the more likely it is that you will

Give yourself an immediate competitive advantage by focusing on all the reasons you will succeed

Those who believe they can improve, DO

Focus on the meaning that can be derived from a job, transforming it into a calling.
Look at your goals in life, how can these tasks be connected to this larger purpose?

Pygmalion effect: When our belief in another person's potential brings that potential to life

Positive tetris effect: Positivity, Gratitude and Optimism

Predictive enconding: Priming yourself to expect a favourable outcome

Write down or say "Three good things" that happened that day

Things do not necessarily happen for the best, but you have to make the best out of things that happen

We have the power to consciously select a counterfact that makes us feel fortunate rather than helpless

How we choose to explain the nmature of past events, has crucial impact on happiness and future success

ABCD model: Adversity, Belief, Consequence and Disputation ( re-read page 125 )

Verbalising the stress and helplessness you are feeling is the first step towards regaining control.
Next, identify which aspects of the situation you have control over and which you don't.
For the ones you do, make small goals you can quickly accomplish.
Forget about the ones you have no control over.

Set goals of moderate difficulty, not so easy you don't have to try, not so hard you get discouraged and give up

Lower the activation energy for habits you want to adopt, and raise it for habits you want to avoid

When we encounter an unexpected challenge or threat, the only way to save ourselves is to hold on tight to the people aorund us and not let go

When a colleague stops you in the hallway at work to say hello and ask about your day, this brief interaction actually sparks a continual upwards spiral of happiness

People interviewed clearly loved what they did largely because they loved who they did it with

The greatest predictor of a team's achievement was how the members felt about one another

Upon receiving someone's good, respond giving enthusiastic support, specific comments and follow-up questions:
Ex. "That's wonderful! I'm glad your boss noticed how hard you've been working. When does the promotion go into effect?"

SMILE, it activates mirror neurons on others
